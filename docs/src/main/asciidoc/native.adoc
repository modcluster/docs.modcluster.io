== Apache httpd configuration

You need to load the modules that are needed for mod_proxy_cluster for example:

[source]
----
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy_ajp_module modules/mod_proxy_ajp.so
LoadModule cluster_slotmem_module modules/mod_cluster_slotmem.so
LoadModule manager_module modules/mod_manager.so
LoadModule proxy_cluster_module modules/mod_proxy_cluster.so
LoadModule advertise_module modules/mod_advertise.so
----

NOTE: *mod_cluster 1.2.x and older:* Note that mod_cluster 1.2.x and older used different
name for the slotmem module (`LoadModule slotmem_module modules/mod_slotmem.so` instead of
the current `LoadModule cluster_slotmem_module modules/mod_cluster_slotmem.so`).

mod_proxy and mod_proxy_ajp are standard httpd modules. mod_cluster_slotmem is a shared slotmem
memory provider. mod_manager is the module that reads information from JBoss AS/JBossWeb/Tomcat
and updates the shared memory information. mod_proxy_cluster is the module that contains the
balancer for mod_proxy. mod_advertise is an additional module that allows httpd to advertise via
multicast packets the IP and port where the mod_proxy_cluster is listening. This multi-module
architecture allows the modules to easily be changed depending on what the customer wants to do.

For example when using http instead of AJP, only:

[source]
----
LoadModule proxy_ajp_module modules/mod_proxy_ajp.so
----

has to be changed to:

[source]
----
LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so
----

== mod_proxy configuration

mod_proxy directives like ProxyIOBufferSize could be used to configure mod_proxy_cluster. There is no need to use ProxyPass
directives because mod_proxy_cluster automatically configures which URLs have to be forwarded to JBossWEB.

== mod_slotmem/mod_cluster_slotmem configuration

The current version does not require any configuration directives.

== mod_proxy_cluster

=== CreateBalancers

CreateBalancers define how balancers are created in the httpd VirtualHosts. This is to allow directives like:

[source]
----
ProxyPass / balancer://mycluster1/
----

* 0 &mdash; Create in all VirtualHosts defined in httpd.

* 1 &mdash; Don't create balancers (requires at least one ProxyPass/ProxyPassMatch to define the balancer names).

* 2 &mdash; Create only the main server.

*Default:* 2

NOTE: *CreateBalancers 1:* When using 1 don't forget to configure the balancer in the ProxyPass directive, because the default is
empty stickysession and `nofailover=Off` and the values received via the MCMP CONFIG message are ignored.

NOTE: *Default: 2* If you have no `ProxyPass` directive in the `VirtualHost`, the `VirtualHost` is ignored
by mod_proxy_cluster. So, even if `CreateBalancers` is set to `2` (default), the main server is used instead
in such configuration.
See also https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MODCLUSTER-430[MODCLUSTER-430 &mdash; CreateBalancers behave the same with option 0 or 2]


=== UseAlias

Check that the Alias corresponds to the ServerName (See http://labs.jboss.com/file-access/default/members/jbossweb/freezone/docs/latest/config/host.html[Host Name Aliases]).

* Off &mdash; Don't check (ignore Aliases)
* On &mdash; Check aliases

*Default:* Off Ignore the Alias information from the nodes.

NOTE: *Older mod_cluster versions:* Versions older than 1.3.1.Final only accept values 0 and 1 respectively.

NOTE: UseAlias should be used with `ProxyPreserveHost On` to work propertly.

=== LBstatusRecalTime
Time interval in seconds for loadbalancing logic to recalculate the status of a node.

*Default:* 5 seconds

The actual formula to recalculate the status of a node is:

[source]
----
status = lbstatus + (elected - oldelected) * 1000) / lbfactor;
----

lbfactor is received for the node via STATUS messages.lbstatus is recalculated every LBstatusRecalTime seconds using the formula:
`lbstatus = (elected - oldelected) * 1000) / lbfactor`

where `elected` is the amount of time the worker has been elected. `oldelected` is `elected` from the last time the `lbstatus`
was recalculated. The node with the lowest `status` is selected. Nodes with `lbfactor â‰¤ 0` are skipped by the both calculation logics.

=== WaitBeforeRemove

Time in seconds before a removed node is forgotten by httpd.

**Default:** 10 seconds

=== ProxyPassMatch/ProxyPass

ProxyPassMatch and ProxyPass are mod_proxy directives that when using `!` (instead the back-end url) prevent to
reverse-proxy in the path. This could be used allow httpd to serve static information like images.

[source]
----
ProxyPassMatch ^(/.*\.gif)$ !
----

The above for example will allow httpd to server directly the .gif files.

=== EnableOptions

Use `OPTIONS` method to periodically check the active connection. Fulfils the same role as the `CPING/CPONG` used by AJP
but for HTTP/HTTPS connections. The endpoint needs to implement HTTP/1.0.

 * On (or no value) &mdash; Use OPTIONS
 * Off &mdash; Don't use OPTIONS

**Default:** On

=== AJPSecret

Use `AJPSecret your_secret` to provide the secret for the AJP back-end, See mod_proxy_ajp and mod_proxy docs for more
information. If `your_secret` doesn't correspond to the value configured in the back-end the back-end will return 503
to any request coming through the proxy.

=== EnableWsTunnel

Use ws or wss instead of http or https when creating nodes (allows WebSocket proxying).

=== WSUpgradeHeader

Use `WSUpgradeHeader value` to define the value of the upgrade header that is accepted. Accepted values are
following:

|===
| 2.0 (in development) | 1.3   | Description
| value                | value | protocol name to check before using the WS tunnel (corresponds to ProxyPass upgrade=value)
| *                    | ANY   | read the header value from request
|                      | NONE  | bypass the header check
|===

See mod_proxy_wstunnel (1.3.x and older) and mod_proxy_http (2.x) docs for more information.

=== ResponseFieldSize

Size in bytes of the HTTP/1.1 buffers of the workers, that limits the header size a webapp
can use (Note: In Tomcat there is  maxHttpHeaderSize that also limits it in the Connector).

**Default:** 8192

=== CacheShareFor

Time to cache the shared memory information in seconds.

**Default:** 0 (no-caching)

=== ModProxyClusterThreadCount

Number of threads that should be created for watchdog logic. Must be positive. (Since 2.0)

**Default:** 16

=== DeterministicFailover

Controls whether a node upon failover is chosen deterministically.

**Default:** Off

== mod_manager

The Context of a mod_manger directive is VirtualHost except mentioned otherwise. **server config** means that it must be outside a
VirtualHost configuration. If not an error message will be displayed and httpd will not start.

=== EnableMCPMReceive

EnableMCPMReceive &mdash; allow the VirtualHost to receive Mod-Cluster Management Protocol (MCMP) messages. You need one
EnableMCPMReceive in your httpd configuration to allow mod_proxy_cluster to work, put it in the VirtualHost where you
configure advertise.

This directive was added so as to address the issue of receiving MCMP on arbitrary VirtualHosts which was problematic
due to accepting messages on insecure, unintended VirtualHosts.

**Default:** disabled (presence of the directive enables this funcitonality)

=== MemManagerFile

That is the base name for the names mod_manager will use to store configuration, generate keys for shared memory or lock
files. That must be an absolute path name; the directories will created if needed. It is highly recommended that those
files are placed on a local drive and not an NFS share. (Context: **server config**)

**Default:** `$server_root/logs/`

=== Maxsessionid

////
TODO
////

Maxsessionid: That is the number of active sessionid we store to give
number of active sessions in the mod_cluster-manager handler. A session
is inactive when mod_cluster doesn't receive any information from the
session in 5 minutes. (Context: server config)

**Default:** 0 (the logic is not activated).

=== MaxMCMPMaxMessSize

MaxMCMPMaxMessSize: Maximum size of MCMP messages. from other Max
directives.

**Default:** calculated from other Max directives. Min: 1024

=== ManagerBalancerName

ManagerBalancerName: That is the name of balancer to use when the JBoss
AS/JBossWeb/Tomcat doesn't provide a balancer name.

**Default:** mycluster

=== PersistSlots

PersistSlots: Tell mod_cluster_slotmem to persist the nodes, Alias and Context
in files. (Context: server config)

**Default:** Off

=== CheckNonce

CheckNonce: Switch check of nonce when using mod_cluster-manager
handler on | off Since 1.1.0.CR1

**Default:** on (Nonce checked)

=== AllowDisplay

AllowDisplay: Switch additional display on mod_cluster-manager main
page on | off Since 1.1.0.GA

**Default:** off (Only version displayed)

=== AllowCmd

AllowCmd: Allow commands using mod_cluster-manager URL on | off Since
mod_cluster 1.1.0.GA

**Default:** on (Commands allowed)

=== ReduceDisplay

ReduceDisplay - Reduce the information the main mod_cluster-manager
page to allow more nodes in the page. on | off

**Default:** off (Full information displayed)

=== SetHandler mod_cluster-manager

SetHandler mod_cluster-manager: That is the handler to display the node
mod_proxy_cluster sees from the cluster. It displays the information about
the nodes like INFO and additionally counts the number of active
sessions.

[source]
----
# httpd 2.2.x or older
<Location /mod_cluster-manager>
   SetHandler mod_cluster-manager
   Order deny,allow
   Deny from all
   Allow from 127.0.0.1
</Location>

# httpd 2.4.x or later
<Location /mod_cluster-manager>
   SetHandler mod_cluster-manager
   Require ip 127.0.0
</Location>
----

When accessing the location you define in httpd.conf you get something
like:

image::native-mod-cluster-manager.jpg[]

Note that:

* **Transferred**: Corresponds to the POST data send to the back-end server.

* **Connected**: Corresponds to the number of requests been processed when the
mod_proxy_cluster status page was requested.

* **sessions**: Corresponds to the number of sessions mod_proxy_cluster report as
active (on which there was a request during the past 5 minutes). That
field is not present when Maxsessionid is zero.

=== mod_advertise

mod_advertise uses multicast packets to advertise the VirtualHost where it is
configured that must be the same VirtualHost where mod_manager is defined. Of
course at least one mod_advertise must be in the VirtualHost to allow
mod_proxy_cluster to find the right IP and port to give to the ClusterListener.

=== ServerAdvertise

ServerAdvertise On: Use the advertise mechanism to tell the JBoss
AS/JBossWeb/Tomcat to whom it should send the cluster information.

ServerAdvertise On http://hostname:port: Tell the hostname and port to use.
Only needed if the VirtualHost is not defined correctly, if the VirtualHost is
a http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/name-based.html[Name-based Virtual Host]
or when VirtualHost is not used.

ServerAdvertise Off: Don't use the advertise mechanism.

**Default:** Off. (Any Advertise directive in a VirtualHost sets it to On in
the VirtualHost)

=== AdvertiseGroup

AdvertiseGroup IP:port: That is the multicast address to use (something like 232.0.0.2:8888 for example).
IP should correspond to AdvertiseGroupAddress and port to AdvertisePort in the JBoss AS/JBossWeb/Tomcat configuration.
Note that if JBoss AS is used and the -u startup switch is included in the AS startup command, the default AdvertiseGroupAddress
is the value passed via the -u. If port is missing the default port will be used: 23364.

**Default:** 224.0.1.105:23364.

=== AdvertiseFrequency

AdvertiseFrequency seconds[.miliseconds]: Time between the multicast
messages advertising the IP and port.

**Default:** 10

=== AdvertiseSecurityKey

AdvertiseSecurityKey value: key string used to verify advertisements checksums. If configured on either side the verification
is required. Both sides must use the same security key.

**Default:** No default value.

=== AdvertiseManagerUrl

AdvertiseManagerUrl value: Not used in this version (It is sent in the X-Manager-Url: value header). That is the URL that
JBoss AS/JBossWeb/Tomcat should use to send information to mod_cluster

**Default:** No default value. Information not sent.

=== AdvertiseBindAddress

AdvertiseBindAddress IP:port: That is the address and port httpd is bind to send the multicast messages.
This allow to specify an address on multi IP address boxes.

**Default:** 0.0.0.0:23364

== Minimal Example

Beware of the different names of `mod_cluster_slotmem.so` and `mod_slotmem.so` between mod_cluster 1.3.x and older versions.
Last but not least, pay attention to httpd 2.2.x and httpd 2.4.x authentication configuration changes.

== Building httpd modules

mod_cluster 1.3.x and older, both httpd modules and Tomcat/WildFly java libraries reside in the
https://github.com/modcluster/mod_cluster[mod_cluster] repository, branches 1.3.x and 1.2.x. New
development of mod_cluster httpd modules takes place under a new name mod_proxy_cluster in the
new repository https://github.com/modcluster/mod_proxy_cluster[mod_proxy_cluster].

See https://asciinema.org/a/7563u1eu6o5jlg3a0gk4wv69f?t=52[ASCII recorded tutorial] on httpd modules
compilation with your own system's httpd.

=== Build with httpd on Windows

We assume you already have a functional Apache HTTP Server on Windows. This example works with
Apache Lounge HTTP Server.
We also assume the system has MS Visual Studio (Community Edition is ample) and CMake installed.
The example operates in cmder shell, but it is not mandatory. A simple Windows cmd prompt would work too.

 * Download the https://www.apachelounge.com/download/[Apache Lounge distribution]. Our example uses
   https://www.apachelounge.com/download/VS17/binaries/httpd-2.4.55-win64-VS17.zip[httpd-2.4.55-win64-VS17.zip].
 * unzipped:

[source]
----
C:\Users\karm
ls
httpd-2.4.55-win64-VS17/ httpd-2.4.55-win64-VS17.zip
----

 * Clone mod_proxy_cluster sources git:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/modcluster/mod_proxy_cluster.git
----

or download https://github.com/modcluster/mod_proxy_cluster/archive/main.zip[zipped main branch directly].

* Proceed with env vars set and CMake build directory preparation:

[source]
----
C:\Users\karm\mod_proxy_cluster\native (main)
mkdir build

C:\Users\karm\mod_proxy_cluster\native (main)
cd build\

C:\Users\karm\mod_proxy_cluster\native\build (main)
vcvars64.bat
----

Here comes the only slightly tricky part: Apache Lounge httpd ships all necessary *.lib files with exported symbols but
for mod_proxy. Since mod_proxy is our dependency, we have to generate these exported symbols from mod_proxy dll.

[source]
----
dumpbin /exports C:\Users\karm\Apache24\modules\mod_proxy.so> C:\Users\karm\Apache24\modules\mod_proxy.exports

echo LIBRARY mod_proxy.so> C:\Users\karm\Apache24\modules\mod_proxy.def

echo EXPORTS>> C:\Users\karm\Apache24\modules\mod_proxy.def

for /f "skip=19 tokens=4" %A in (C:\Users\karm\Apache24\modules\mod_proxy.exports) do echo %A >> C:\Users\karm\Apache24\modules\mod_proxy.def

lib /def:C:\Users\karm\Apache24\modules\mod_proxy.def /OUT:C:\Users\karm\Apache24\modules\mod_proxy.lib /MACHINE:X64 /NAME:mod_proxy.so
----

Let's run CMake:

[source]
----

----

Compile

[source]
----
C:\Users\karm\mod_proxy_cluster\native\build (main)
nmake
----

Directory modules now contains all necessary modules:

[source]

'modules/mod_proxy_cluster.so' -> 'C:/Users/karm/Apache24/modules/mod_proxy_cluster.so'
----

Done.

=== Build httpd from its sources

To build httpd-2.2.x from its sources see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/install.html[ASF httpd 2.2 doc],
see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/install.html[ASF httpd 2.4 doc] for httpd-2.4.x.

If needed, patch the httpd-2.2.x sources with (The patch prevents long
waiting time when the node IP can't be resolved that should not happen
so you can skip the patch part if you don't want to rebuild httpd).
https://github.com/modcluster/mod_cluster/blob/main/native/mod_proxy_cluster/mod_proxy_ajp.patch[mod_proxy_ajp.patch]

    (cd modules/proxy
      patch -p0 < $location/mod_proxy_ajp.patch
    )

Configure httpd with something like:

    ./configure  --prefix=apache_installation_directory \
                 --with-mpm=worker \
                 --enable-mods-shared=most \
                 --enable-maintainer-mode \
                 --with-expat=builtin \
                 --enable-ssl \
                 --enable-proxy \
                 --enable-proxy-http \
                 --enable-proxy-ajp \
                 --disable-proxy-balancer

Rebuild (make) and reinstall (make install) after that.

=== Build the 4 modules of mod_cluster

You need an httpd installation with mod_proxy (`--enable-proxy`) and ajp
protocol (`--enable-proxy-ajp`) enabled and with dso enabled (`--enable-so`).

Download the mod_proxy_cluster sources:

    git clone git://github.com/modcluster/mod_proxy_cluster.git

Build the mod_proxy_cluster's modules components, for each subdirectory
advertise, mod_manager, mod_proxy_cluster and mod_cluster_slotmem (mod_slotmem
for version 1.2 or older) do
something like:

[source,bash]
----
sh buildconf
 ./configure --with-apxs=apxs_file_location
 make
 cp *.so apache_installation_directory/modules
----

Where apache_installation_directory is the location of an installed
version of httpd-2-2.x or newer.
The https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/programs/apxs.html[apxs] file can be
found in your apache_installation_directory/bin directory.

NOTE: You can ignore the libtool message on most platform:

[source,bash]
----
libtool: install: warning: remember to run `libtool --finish apache_installation_directory/modules'
----

Once that is done use Apache httpd configuration to configure mod_proxy_cluster.

=== Build the mod_proxy module

It is only needed for httpd-2.2.x where x â‰¤ 11. Process like the other mod_proxy_cluster modules.

== Installing httpd modules

Several bundles are available at http://www.jboss.org/mod_cluster/downloads.html[http://www.jboss.org/mod_cluster/downloads.html].

////
TODO: Amend links. The following article is dated.
////


In case you can't find a prepared package of mod_cluster in the download area, it is possible to build mod_cluster for the sources.
You need a distribution of httpd (at least 2.2.8) or (better) a source tarball of httpd and the sources of mod_cluster.

=== Configuration

////
TODO
////


A minimal configuration is needed in httpd.
A listener must be a added in in JBossWEB conf/server.xml.

==== Installing and using the bundles

The bundles are tar.gz on POSIX platforms just extract them in root something like:

[source,bash]
----
cd /
tar xvf mod-cluster-1.x.y-linux2-x86-ssl.tar.gz
----

The httpd.conf is located in */opt/jboss/httpd/httpd/conf* to quick test
just add something like in the minimal example.

To start httpd do the following:

    httpd/sbin/apachectl start

NOTE: Make sure to use SSL before going in production.

== Using SSL in mod_cluster

Forwarding SSL browser information when using http/https between httpd and JBossWEB:

There are 2 connections between the cluster and the front-end. Both
could be encrypted. That chapter describes how to encrypt both
connections.

=== Using SSL between JBossWEB and httpd

As the ClusterListener allows to configure httpd it is advised to use
SSL for that connection. The most easy is to use a virtual host that
will only be used to receive information from JBossWEB. Both side need
configuration.

==== Apache httpd configuration part

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_ssl.html[mod_ssl] of httpd is using to do that.
See in one example how easy the configuration is:

[source]
----
Listen 8090

<VirtualHost 10.33.144.3:8090>
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCipherSuite AES128-SHA:ALL:!ADH:!LOW:!MD5:!SSLV2:!NULL
    SSLCertificateFile conf/server.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile conf/server.key
    SSLCACertificateFile conf/server-ca.crt
    SSLVerifyClient require
    SSLVerifyDepth 10
</VirtualHost>
----

The conf/server.crt file is the PEM-encoded Certificate file for the
VirtualHost it must be signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) whose
certificate is stored in the sslTrustStore of the ClusterListener
parameter.

The conf/server.key file is the file containing the private key.

The conf/server-ca.crt file is the file containing the certificate of the
CA that have signed the client certificate JBossWEB is using. That is
the CA that have signed the certificate corresponding to the sslKeyAlias
stored in the sslKeyStore of the ClusterListener parameters.

==== ClusterListener configuration part

There is a xref:developer/index.adoc#ClusterListener[ModCluster Listener] article
describing the SSL parameters of the ClusterListener. See in one example
how easy the configuration is:

[source,xml]
----
<Listener className="org.jboss.web.cluster.ClusterListener"
          ssl="true"
          sslKeyStorePass="changeit"
          sslKeyStore="/home/jfclere/CERTS/CA/test.p12"
          sslKeyStoreType="PKCS12"
          sslTrustStore="/home/jfclere/CERTS/CA/ca.p12"
          sslTrustStoreType="PKCS12"
          sslTrustStorePassword="changeit"
          />
----

The sslKeyStore file contains the private key and the signed certificate
of the client certificate JBossWEB uses to connect to httpd. The
certificate must be signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) who certificate
is in the conf/server-ca.crt file of the httpd

The sslTrustStore file contains the CA certificate of the CA that signed
the certificate contained in conf/server.crt file.

==== mod-cluster-jboss-beans configuration part

The `mod-cluster-jboss-beans.xml` in
`$JBOSS_HOME/server/*profile*/deploy/mod-cluster.sar/META-INF` in the
ClusterConfig you are using you should have something like:

[source,xml]
----
<property name="ssl">true</property>
<property name="sslKeyStorePass">changeit</property>
<property name="sslKeyStore">/home/jfclere/CERTS/test.p12</property>
<property name="sslKeyStoreType">pkcs12</property>
<property name="sslTrustStore">/home/jfclere/CERTS/ca.p12</property>
<property name="sslTrustStoreType">pkcs12</property>
<property name="sslTrustStorePassword">changeit</property>
----

===== How the different files were created

The files were created using OpenSSL utilities see
http://www.openssl.org/[OpenSSL] CA.pl (/etc/pki/tls/misc/CA for
example) has been used to create the test Certificate authority, the
certificate requests and private keys as well as signing the certificate
requests.

[[createca]]
===== Create the CA

Create a work directory and work for there:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p CERTS/Server
cd CERTS/Server
----

Create a new CA:

[source,bash]
----
/etc/pki/tls/misc/CA -newca
----

That creates a directory for example ../../CA that contains a
cacert.pem file which content have to be added to the
conf/server-ca.crt described above.

Export the CA certificate to a .p12 file:

[source,bash]
----
openssl pkcs12 -export -nokeys -in ../../CA/cacert.pem -out ca.p12
----

That reads the file cacert.pem that was created in the previous step
and convert it into a pkcs12 file the JVM is able to read.

That is the ca.p12 file used in the _sslTrustStore_ parameter above.

[[createsc]]
===== Create the server certificate

Create a new request:

[source,bash]
----
/etc/pki/tls/misc/CA -newreq
----

That creates 2 files named newreq.pem and newkey.pem. newkey.pem is
the file conf/server.key described above.

Sign the request:

[source,bash]
----
/etc/pki/tls/misc/CA -signreq
----

That creates a file named newcert.pem. newcert.pem is the file
conf/server.crt described above. At that point you have created the
SSL stuff needed for the VirtualHost in httpd. You should use a
browser to test it after importing in the browser the content of the
cacert.pem file.

===== Create the client certificate

Create a work directory and work for there:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p CERTS/Client
cd CERTS/Client
----

Create request and key for the JBossWEB part.

[source,bash]
----
/etc/pki/tls/misc/CA -newreq
----

That creates 2 files: Request is in newreq.pem, private key is in
newkey.pem

Sign the request.

[source,bash]
----
/etc/pki/tls/misc/CA -signreq
----

That creates a file: newcert.pem

Don't use a passphrase when creating the client certificate or remove
it before exporting:

[source,bash]
----
openssl rsa -in newkey.pem -out key.txt.pem
mv key.txt.pem newkey.pem
----

Export the client certificate and key into a p12 file.

[source,bash]
----
openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey newkey.pem -in newcert.pem -out test.p12
----

That is the sslKeyStore file described above
(/home/jfclere/CERTS/CA/test.p12)

==== Using SSL between httpd and JBossWEB

Using https allows to encrypt communications between httpd and JBossWEB.
But due to the resources it needs that no advised to use it in high
load configuration.

See xref:developer/index.adoc#encrypting-connection-tomcat[Encrypting connection between httpd and TC] for detailed instructions.

httpd is configured to be a client for AS/TC, so it should provide a
certificate AS/TC will accept and have a private key to encrypt the
data, it also needs a CA certificate to valid the certificate AS/TC will
use for the connection.

[source]
----
SSLProxyEngine On
SSLProxyVerify require
SSLProxyCACertificateFile conf/cacert.pem
SSLProxyMachineCertificateFile conf/proxy.pem
----

conf/proxy.pem should contain both key and certificate. The certificate
must be trusted by Tomcat via the CA in truststoreFile of
&lt;connector/&gt;.

conf/cacert.pem must contain the certificate of the CA that signed the
AS/TC certificate. The correspond key and certificate are the pair
specified by keyAlias and truststoreFile of the &lt;connector/&gt;. Of
course the &lt;connector/&gt; must be the https one (normally on port 8443).

===== How the different files were created

The files were created using OpenSSL utilities see
http://www.openssl.org/[OpenSSL] CA.pl (/etc/pki/tls/misc/CA for
example) has been used to create the test Certificate authority, the
certificate requests and private keys as well as signing the certificate
requests.

===== Create the CA

(See link:#createca[above])

===== Create the server certificate

(See link:#createsc[above])

The certificate and key need to be imported into the java keystore using
keytool

make sure you don't use a passphrase for the key (don't forget to clean
the file when done)

Convert the key and certificate to p12 file:

[source,bash]
----
openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey key.pem -in newcert.pem -out test.p12
----

make sure you use the keystore password as Export passphrase.

Import the contents of the p12 file in the keystore:

[source,bash]
----
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore test.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12
----

Import the CA certificate in the java trust store: (Fedora 13 example).

[source,bash]
----
keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias "caname" -file  ../../CA/cacert.pem -keystore /etc/pki/java/cacerts
----

Edit server.xml to have a &lt;connector/&gt; similar to:

[source,xml]
----
<Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true"
           keyAlias="1"
           truststoreFile="/etc/pki/java/cacerts"
           maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
           clientAuth="true" sslProtocol="TLS" />
----

Start TC/AS and use openssl s_client to test the connection:

[source,bash]
----
openssl s_client -CAfile /home/jfclere/CA/cacert.pem -cert newcert.pem -key newkey.pem -host localhost -port 8443
----

There shouldn't be any error, and you should be able to see your CA
in the "Acceptable client certificate CA names".

==== Forwarding SSL browser information when using http/https between httpd and JBossWEB

When using http or https between httpd and JBossWEB you need to use the
SSLValve and export the SSL variable as header in the request in httpd.
If you are using AJP, mod_proxy_ajp will read the SSL variables and
forward them to JBossWEB automatically.

See xref:developer/index.adoc#modproxy-forwarding[Forwarding SSL environment when using http/https proxy] for detailed instructions.

The SSL variable used by mod_proxy_ajp are the following:

. "HTTPS" SSL indicator.
. "SSL_CLIENT_CERT" Chain of client certificates.
. "SSL_CIPHER" The cipher used.
. "SSL_SESSION_ID" The ID of the session.
. "SSL_CIPHER_USEKEYSIZE" Size of the key used.
